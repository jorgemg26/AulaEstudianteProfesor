## AulaEstudianteProfesor <br>
· A simulation of 3 classrooms, 3 teachers and the students decided by you, playing with `random possibilities` <br>
· The program will ask the number of `students` and some info about them <br>
· Then it will ask info about the `teachers` <br>
· The `classrooms` are created automatically <br>
· At the `end` it will show info about the attendance of the classroom, and if it is possible to do the class or not <br>
· The class is `not possible` if the teacher doesn´t appear, or if the 50% of the students don´t appear (it is random)
· Only using `Java`
